Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects.

Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is deﬁned as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefﬁcient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially signiﬁcant causal effects.},

Half of this gain disappears over the next ﬁve years as other retail establishments exit and contract, leaving a long-run statistically signiﬁcant net gain of 50 jobs. Wholesale employment declines by approximately 20 jobs due to Wal-Mart’s vertical integration.

To identify the causal e ect of Carnegie libraries on innovation, we use new data on city-level patenting and a novel control group: cities that quali ed to receive a library grant, applied for the program, received preliminary construction approval, but ultimately did not build a Carnegie library. Patenting in recipient towns increased by 8-13 percent in the 20 years following library entry. We show that this increase is concentrated in technology classes that overlap with library holdings. The number of women and immigrant inventors also increased after libraries opened.

The interpretation of such estimates is complicated by the fact that they reﬂect both partial equilibrium and local general equilibrium eﬀects of the shocks. We propose an approach for recovering estimates of partial equilibrium eﬀects from these cross-regional empirical estimates. The basic idea is to divide the cross-regional estimate by an estimate of the local ﬁscal multiplier, which measures the strength of local general equilibrium ampliﬁcation. We apply this approach to recent estimates of housing wealth eﬀects based on city-level variation, and derive conditions under which the adjustment is exact. We then evaluate its accuracy in a richer general equilibrium model of consumption and housing. The paper also reconciles the positive cross-sectional correlation between house price growth and construction with the notion that cities with larger price volatility have lower housing supply elasticities using a model in which housing supply elasticities are more dispersed in the long run than in the short run.},

We ﬁrst show that ﬁxed length conﬁdence intervals have near-optimal expected length for a practically-relevant class of restrictions. We next introduce a novel inference procedure that accommodates a wider range of restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends, and is based on the observation that inference in our setting is equivalent to testing a system of moment inequalities with a large number of linear nuisance parameters. The resulting conﬁdence sets are consistent, and have optimal local asymptotic power for many parameter conﬁgurations.

The rates of convergence depend on the rate at which the amount of interference grows and the degree to which it aligns with dependencies in treatment assignment. Importantly for practitioners, the results imply that if one erroneously assumes that units do not interfere in a setting with limited, or even moderate, interference, standard estimators are nevertheless likely to be close to an average treatment eﬀect if the sample is suﬃciently large.

	abstractnote = {For decades, social scientists have been trying to answer causal questions about the effectiveness of certain programs or policies. The conventional methodology for answering such causal questions relies on the “no interference between different units” assumption; that is, a unit’s outcome depends solely on the treatment that the unit is assigned to (or exposed to) and does not depend on the treatment assignment (or exposure) of other units in the population. However, this assumption is likely to be violated in spatial settings because of various spillover, diffusion, and displacement effects. In this paper, we present a case study evaluating the causal effects of Chicago’s community policing program (a community-wide intervention) on neighborhoods’ crime rates. We use semiannual crime data from Chicago to evaluate (1) whether community policing is more effective at decreasing rates of reported personal crime when implemented everywhere versus nowhere in a city; (2) whether community policing is effective if implemented in a single local area, holding constant policing in adjacent areas; (3) whether implementing community policing in surrounding areas affects crime in a focal area; and (4) whether community policing’s impact on crime in surrounding areas depends on whether community policing is also implemented in the focal area. To answer these questions, we relax the no-interference assumption. Our approach allows the potential outcomes in any local area to depend on a function of the treatment assignments in all other units. We define causal effects and evaluate assumptions that make the framework tractable within the framework of a generalized linear model with spatially auto-correlated random effects.},
